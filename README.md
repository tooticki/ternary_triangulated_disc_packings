# ternary_triangulated_disc_packings
This project contains the SageMath code supporting the proof of Theorem 1. 

Folder **a** contains the supporting code for the proof of (a):
> For the 16 following cases: 53, 54, 55, 56, 66, 76, 77, 79, 93, 108, 115,
116, 118, 129, 131, 146, the density is maximized by a triangulated
ternary packing.

Folder **b** contains the supporting code for the proof of (b):
> For the cases 1–15, the density is maximized by triangulated binary
packings. For cases 1–5, it is the triangulated packing of b 8 ; for case
6 — b 4 ; for cases 7–9 — b 7 ; for cases 10–16 — b 9.

Folder **c** contains the supporting code for the proof of (c):
> For the 40 following cases: 19, 20, 25, 47, 51, 60, 63, 64, 70, 73, 80,
92, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 104, 110, 111, 117, 119, 126, 132, 133, 135,
136, 137, 138, 139, 141, 142, 151, 152, 154, 159, 161, 162, 163, 164,
there exists a non-triangulated packing denser than any triangulated
one.
